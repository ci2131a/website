# Personal Website Repository

This repository holds all the code for the development version of my personal website. The final product of HTML and CSS is copied to the live version. There is probably a better way to do it but this works for me. An initial exercise was done with JT using Vue so this continues the use of that framework. The guide found at https://blog.logrocket.com/build-deploy-vue-js-app-github-pages/ was consulted for confirmation that the setup was completed successfully. Josh was nice enough to assist with formatting issues as well when things hit the fan.
