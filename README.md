# Personal Website Repository

This repository holds all the code for my personal website https://ci2131a.github.io/website/. An initial exercise was done with JT using Vue and so this makes use of that framework. The guide found at https://blog.logrocket.com/build-deploy-vue-js-app-github-pages/ was consulted for confirmation that the setup was completed successfully.
