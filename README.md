# Personal Website Repository

This repository holds all the code for my personal website https://ci2131a.github.io/website/. An initial exercise was done with JT using Vue and so this makes use of that framework. The guide found at https://blog.logrocket.com/build-deploy-vue-js-app-github-pages/ was consulted for confirmation that the setup was completed successfully. 



## Modification Process

In order to actually make and observe changes on the live GitHub pages site use the following steps:

1. Make all changes in the relevant files locally in directory.
2. Push relevant changes to Master branch of repository.
3. Run `npm run deploy` on Bash in directory. 
4. Launch site to see changes.
