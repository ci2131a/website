Several different approaches were possible depending on the type of risk that was of interest.

Survival models analyze the time to event and can be leveraged to look at the time to first event. Through a random effects term, a multi-observation scheme data set can be used in a survival model to analyze the risk of repeated events. Lastly, the Multi-State Model (MSM) can look at transitions between predefined LBP states to evaluate the risk of transitioning between them.
