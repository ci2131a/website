The face shields consisted of 3D printed headbands made of polylactic acid (PLA) and laser cut visors from (PETE). They also included an elastic band to secure the head piece in place. Each team member had a printer to make the PLA headbands separately which took about 2 hours to make one. If multiple were printed on the same sheet at once, the number of headbands that could be printed in a day was increased.
